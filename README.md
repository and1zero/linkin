# Linkin

A generic URL shortener project.

The initial business requirements are:
* The link shortener should be able to receive a URL and give back a shortened URL.
* When a user accesses the shortened URL he should be redirected to the full URL.
* It should have an API endpoint where you can query stats around a particular shortened URL giving you details about the users that have visited the URL with as much information as you can get on that person.

## Demo

This project is deployed in heroku: https://hanami-linkin.herokuapp.com/

## Project Setup

How to run tests:

```
% bundle exec rake
```

How to run the development console:

```
% bundle exec hanami console
```

How to run the development server:

```
% bundle exec hanami server

## ROADMAP

Several improvements can be done to this app.

- [ ] Write a more scalable query for fetching stats. Currently everything is handled in Javascript, but aggregation and time range filter should happen on the client side.
- [ ] We can add authentication and scope each shortened URLs by user.
- [ ] We can integrate Webpack to this project to have rich experience in frontend development.
